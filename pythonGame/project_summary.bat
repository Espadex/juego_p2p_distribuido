echo Team Race Game - Project Summary
echo ================================
echo.
echo This project implements a team-based racing game with centralized RMI logging.
echo.
echo === PROJECT STRUCTURE ===
echo.
echo Main Scripts:
echo   start_all.bat         - Compile and start all components automatically
echo   run_demo.bat          - Run automated game demonstration
echo   test_system.bat       - Test system connectivity
echo.
echo Individual Components:
echo   compile.bat           - Compile Java RMI components
echo   run_rmi_server.bat    - Start RMI logging server
echo   run_rmi_proxy.bat     - Start RMI TCP proxy
echo   run_game_server.bat   - Start Python game server
echo   run_game_client.bat   - Start game client (for each player)
echo.
echo === QUICK START ===
echo.
echo 1. Run: start_all.bat
echo    (This compiles and starts RMI server, proxy, and game server)
echo.
echo 2. Open multiple terminals and run: run_game_client.bat
echo    (One for each player you want to simulate)
echo.
echo 3. OR run: run_demo.bat
echo    (Automated demo with 4 simulated players)
echo.
echo === FEATURES ===
echo.
echo - Multi-player team racing game on 1D board (configurable size)
echo - Team creation and joining with voting system (50+1 majority)
echo - Turn-based dice rolling where team members' rolls are summed
echo - Real-time notifications across all connected clients
echo - Centralized logging via Java RMI server
echo - TCP proxy for Python-Java RMI communication
echo - Automatic game start voting system
echo - Victory detection and game completion
echo.
echo === SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ===
echo.
echo - Python 3.7+ (for game logic)
echo - Java 8+ (for RMI logging system)
echo - Windows (scripts designed for Windows batch files)
echo.
echo === NETWORK PORTS ===
echo.
echo - 1099: RMI Registry (Java)
echo - 8888: RMI TCP Proxy (Java to Python bridge)  
echo - 12345: Game Server (Python)
echo.
echo === LOG FILES ===
echo.
echo - game_logs.txt: RMI server logs (if RMI system works)
echo - local_logs.json: Local backup logs (if RMI fails)
echo.
echo === ARCHITECTURE ===
echo.
echo Client (Python) <--TCP--> Game Server (Python) <--TCP--> RMI Proxy (Java) <--RMI--> Logging Server (Java)
echo.
echo === DEMO SCENARIO ===
echo.
echo The automated demo creates:
echo - Game "DemoGame" with 2 teams, 2 players per team, board size 20
echo - Team "Rojos": Alice (creator) + Charlie (joins via voting)
echo - Team "Azules": Bob (creator) + Diana (joins via voting)
echo - All players vote to start the game
echo - Players take turns rolling dice until a team wins
echo.
echo All actions are logged via RMI with timestamps and operation details.
